In my ongoing attempt to morph myself into the kind of adult I want to
be, one step has been the theoretically shallow attempt to dress a bit
better. To that end some time ago I brainstormed about a minimal “adult”
wardrobe.

I’ve actually pursued this some, and since some people seemed
interested, I thought I would update.

Here’s the original list:

-   Two well cut dark wash jeans
-   One dark color non-jean pair of casual pants (chino’s, I guess)
-   One pair of proper “dressy” pants
-   One good suit
-   Six or seven nice, but casual button down shirts
-   Two dress shirts
-   A handful of nice ties
-   Good black shoes
-   Good brown shoes
-   Two good blazers/jackets

Of that, I have:

-   One well cut pair of dark wash jeans.
-   One pair of gray flat-front slacks
-   One really nice button down dress shirt
-   Two nice casual button downs
-   Good balck shoes
-   One black blazer

It’s a start. The most interesting thing I found was that much of this
was already in my wardrobe. I just needed to pull those pieces out and
not combine them with cruddy, baggy clothes, since then they looked
awful. And in more than one instance I found actually taking them to the
tailor to get the fit improved was incredibly helpful. Seriously, if
there’s a lesson here, it’s that tailors are your friend.
