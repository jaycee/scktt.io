<div><p>In my ongoing attempt to morph myself into the kind of adult I want to be, one step has been the theoretically shallow attempt to dress a bit better. To that end some time ago I brainstormed about a minimal &#8220;adult&#8221; wardrobe.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve actually pursued this some, and since some people seemed interested, I thought I would update.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the original list:</p>
<ul><li>Two well cut dark wash jeans</li>
<li>One dark color non-jean pair of casual pants (chino&#8217;s, I guess)</li>
<li>One pair of proper &#8220;dressy&#8221; pants</li>
<li>One good suit</li>
<li>Six or seven nice, but casual button down shirts</li>
<li>Two dress shirts</li>
<li>A handful of nice ties</li>
<li>Good black shoes</li>
<li>Good brown shoes</li>
<li>Two good blazers/jackets</li>
</ul><p>Of that, I have:</p>
<ul><li>One well cut pair of dark wash jeans.</li>
<li>One pair of gray flat-front slacks</li>
<li>One really nice button down dress shirt</li>
<li>Two nice casual button downs</li>
<li>Good balck shoes</li>
<li>One black blazer</li>
</ul><p>It&#8217;s a start. The most interesting thing I found was that much of this was already in my wardrobe. I just needed to pull those pieces out and not combine them with cruddy, baggy clothes, since then they looked awful. And in more than one instance I found actually taking them to the tailor to get the fit improved was incredibly helpful. Seriously, if there&#8217;s a lesson here, it&#8217;s that tailors are your friend.</p></div>
