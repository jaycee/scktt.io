Don’t you hate finding out you’ve been deceived by something cool?

So, back in January I posted [this TED Talk from Joshua
Klein](http://blog.humanmade.org/post/72118026/joshua-klein-on-the-intelligence-of-crows-video)
about his work with crows.

The NYTimes had a story about this (Klein, not my posting), which seemed
to back up how cool Mr. Klein and his work was.

Seems a lot of his research wasn’t all there. The NYTimes put up[a
Corrections
piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/magazine/12letters-t-CORRECTIONS-1.html)
about their story; it seemed worth while to share it here.
