An interesting point in time: we are now talking as a species about the
serious viability of traveling space by [travelling on solar
winds](http://www.google.com/search?q=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/science/space/10solar.html).

It’s the stuff of bad space operas—sailing through the stars on huge
mylar sheets. And yet, with the successful flight of LightSail-1, it can
become reality.

Just a fun image for you to carry in your head today.
