I have a spare laptop from the days when I was pursuing linux as my full
time operating system. It’s a nice one—a daru2 from
[system76](http://system76.com).

I’ve been using it at work so that I would have access to a linux
machine while using the windows workstation that I had. Recently though
the department has switched over to linux for everyone (aside from a few
holdouts) so I don’t need a separate linux computer.

This leaves me with a computer to experiment with.

I was thinking I would set it up as a multi-os system using
virtualization. I would set up something very lightweight to run guest
OSes. I thought it would be really cool to use
[esxi](http://www.vmware.com/products/esxi/). However, I have found that
esxi is only really meant for use with servers. You can’t get a visual
interface to your os on the computer running esxi—you can only dial in
from another system.

So, I’m back to needing an actual OS to run a the guests. I want
something ludicrously lightweight, so I guess I need a linux of some
sort. And as long as I’m at it, I may as well have a GUI to manage the
VMs with.

Right now, I’m thinking a stripped down version of Arch running wmii,
but I’m not sold on any one thing yet.
