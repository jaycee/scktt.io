I’m a regular reader of [Waiter Rant](http://waiterrant.net/), and his
[recent article](http://waiterrant.net/?p=2284) gave rise to two points
I specifically have to address.

The first is the main part of the article—the notion that you must tip
extra at the holidays at your regular establishment. I have never ever
heard of such a thing. I’m curious if this is a larger city thing, a
north east corridor thing, or a New York thing.

The second point is his closing line.

I can understand the sentiment, but this is so self-righteous that I
have to call it out. There are a lot of perfectly valid reasons to not
give a penny to the Salvation Army. Now charity? Absolutely you should
give to charity if you have the disposable income. But I have serious
qualms with actions the SA has taken—[like threatening to close their
soup kitchens as a political
maneuver](http://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/ArticleID/1824489).

There’s not much content to this post. Just a question, and an
objection.
