I’ve been playing a lot with the idea of assigning myself something of a
more regular schedule. As nothing more than an expirement, here’s a stab
at an ideal schedule.

-   0500 Wake up.
-   0515 Workout.
-   0600 Make breakfast. Wake up Heather.
-   0630 Walk the dogs.
-   0730 Get back from walking the dogs. Make coffee.
-   0800 Read the paper, feeds, comics, &c
-   0900 Start work.
-   1200 Break for lunch.
-   1230 Side projects, errands, &c
-   1430 Return to work.
-   1730 Standup meeting.
-   1800 Make dinner. Have dinner. Spend time with Heather. Potentially
    do more side project work.
-   2100 Head to bed.
-   2200 Lights out.

Obviously this is just one possible “ideal” schedule. There’s a lot of
questions to raise with this one, but it’s been rattling around in my
head so I thought I should get it written down.
