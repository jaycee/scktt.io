<div><p>I&#8217;ve been playing a lot with the idea of assigning myself something of a more regular schedule. As nothing more than an expirement, here&#8217;s a stab at an ideal schedule.</p>
<ul><li>0500 Wake up.</li>
<li>0515 Workout.</li>
<li>0600 Make breakfast. Wake up Heather.</li>
<li>0630 Walk the dogs.</li>
<li>0730 Get back from walking the dogs. Make coffee.</li>
<li>0800 Read the paper, feeds, comics, &amp;c</li>
<li>0900 Start work.</li>
<li>1200 Break for lunch.</li>
<li>1230 Side projects, errands, &amp;c</li>
<li>1430 Return to work.</li>
<li>1730 Standup meeting.</li>
<li>1800 Make dinner. Have dinner. Spend time with Heather. Potentially do more side project work.</li>
<li>2100 Head to bed.</li>
<li>2200 Lights out.</li>
</ul><p>Obviously this is just one possible &#8220;ideal&#8221; schedule. There&#8217;s a lot of questions to raise with this one, but it&#8217;s been rattling around in my head so I thought I should get it written down.</p></div>
