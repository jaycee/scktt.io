There are two seemingly opposed views you can take when programming.

**The Purist:** *Things should be done in just this one right way, read
in just this one way, work just so.*

**The Realist:** *This* should *be done just so, but for christ’s sake
we just need this to work right now and I need to go get some coffee.*

If you’re not using *both* perspectives when coding, you’re probably
doing something wrong.
