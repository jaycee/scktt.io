I attended Ignite Raleigh this past Wednesday, and I thought I’d put up
my thoughts on the event (yes, I know I’m doing this backward, but
posting barcamp notes is far easier than writing an actual post).

IgniteRaleigh was pretty awesome. The talks ranged from fantastic to
fairly dreadful, but all of them had something interesting to talk
about. The top ones for me were [Wayne
Sutton’s](http://wayne-sutton.com/) “19 Reasons why the Triangle is
better than Silicon Valley” and [Nathaniel
Talbott’s](http://blog.talbott.ws/) “Building a Learning Machine”, a
talk about important steps in building and running a startup.

Naturally, a lot of the rest of the talks centered on social media, and
while it’s certainly a topic of interest, I’ve become pretty bored of
talking about social media.

The talk I had really been interested in at the time was one about the
creation of open mesh networks, but it didn’t really tell me anything I
didn’t know. However, I am convinced that a mesh network in Durham is
easily as feasible as one in Raleigh; potentially even more so, since
one constrained to downtown and its neighborhoods wouldn’t need to be
anywhere near as big as one in Raleigh.

So, as I said, overall, a very good event. I’m really looking forwards
to next year’s, and I may see if I can come up with a talk for it.
