<div><p>I attended Ignite Raleigh this past Wednesday, and I thought I&#8217;d put up my thoughts on the event (yes, I know I&#8217;m doing this backward, but posting barcamp notes is far easier than writing an actual post).</p>
<p>IgniteRaleigh was pretty awesome. The talks ranged from fantastic to fairly dreadful, but all of them had something interesting to talk about. The top ones for me were <a href="http://wayne-sutton.com/">Wayne Sutton&#8217;s</a> &#8220;19 Reasons why the Triangle is better than Silicon Valley&#8221; and <a href="http://blog.talbott.ws/">Nathaniel Talbott&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Building a Learning Machine&#8221;, a talk about important steps in building and running a startup.</p>
<p>Naturally, a lot of the rest of the talks centered on social media, and while it&#8217;s certainly a topic of interest, I&#8217;ve become pretty bored of talking about social media.</p>

<p>The talk I had really been interested in at the time was one about the creation of open mesh networks, but it didn&#8217;t really tell me anything I didn&#8217;t know. However, I am convinced that a mesh network in Durham is easily as feasible as one in Raleigh; potentially even more so, since one constrained to downtown and its neighborhoods wouldn&#8217;t need to be anywhere near as big as one in Raleigh.</p>
<p>So, as I said, overall, a very good event. I&#8217;m really looking forwards to next year&#8217;s, and I may see if I can come up with a talk for it.</p></div>
