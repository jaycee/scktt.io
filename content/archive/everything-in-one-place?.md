So I can now pull my
[1FP](http://1fp.humanmade.org "One Fucking Paragraph") feed into this
blog, because I’ve added all of my blog feeds to feedburner.

The question is, should I? I’ve already seen that two people who follow
me here (via tumblr, not rss) are following me on 1fp as well. I would
hate to saturate lots of people with repeats.

Comments have been put back into place in this (look for the word
comment over on the left by the icon). Let me know what you think.
