For the longest time, this has served as a feed of my del.icio.us links,
my twitter feed, my flickr feed, my lj feed, and so forth. But Iâ€™ve shed
lj, and the rest has all gone over to friendfeed, which does a far
better job of it all. So from here on in, until I find something better,
this has become my blog.

Enjoy the future posts.
