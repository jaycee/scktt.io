As I’ve grown up, I’ve taken stock and noticed my wardrobe of baggy
jeans and hoodies doesn’t really fit for a late-twenties,
soon-to-be-married, recently-tried-to-buy-a-house guy. That, plus the
input of [Put This On](http://putthison.com/) has led me to start
thinking about what a complete but relatively minimal “adult” wardrobe
(that I would want to own) might need.

Here’s my take so far:

-   Two well cut dark wash jeans
-   One dark color non-jean pair of casual pants (chino’s, I guess)
-   One pair of proper “dressy” pants
-   One good suit
-   Six or seven nice, but casual button down shirts
-   Two dress shirts
-   A handful of nice ties
-   Good black shoes
-   Good brown shoes
-   Two good blazers/jackets

I have no idea if this is actually complete, and I’m sure the list bored
you to tears. I’m just brainstorming here.

What are your thoughts?
