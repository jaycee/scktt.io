I had just started college when 9/11 happened. I had, for all intents
and purposes, just started thinking of myself as an adult.

I remember that day very well. I woke up and it seemed like the world
had ended. Remembering that my father had business in/near the Pentagon,
I joined the hundreds trying to reach family and make sure they were
okay.

The day ended, but our problems surely didn’t.

These days, it seems like I’ve basically spent my adult life living in
9/11. It’s everywhere. It’s image is called up all the time, for reasons
personal, political, religious, and other. I understand this. 9/11 was a
tragedy. It was a horrible event, a horrible day, and began a horrible
span of time.

But I am *tired* of living in 9/11. It has been almost a decade, and we
are still caught up in it. We are still talking about a post-9/11 world,
but our post-9/11 world seems awfully bound to an eternal replay of
those days. It’s time for us, as a nation, to *move on*.

Tomorrow is 9/12. I would really like to try living there for a while.
Wouldn’t you?
