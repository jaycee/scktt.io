[A new proposal](http://onefuckingparagraph.tumblr.com "1F¶").

I’m still intent on doing more writing here, but my “one big ass
meaningful post” thing isn’t working. Clearly.

So scratch that. I’ve got another blog up ~~(which I’ll sync to here as
well (thanks tumblr imports))~~ (which will *not* be imported here
because you can’t do that with tumblr feeds). The premise is simple. One
paragraph a day. Just one.

We’ll see how *that* goes.
