<div><p>Periodically I get this overwhelming urge to redo the way I exist on the internet. The last time this happened I tore down an aging textile install and switched over to tumblr for pretty much everything.</p>
<p>This time?</p>
<p>Tumblr will remain; or at least, the tumblr account will remain. I will continue posting links, videos, pictures, &amp;c on it. Textual content of any substantiative nature is going to be migrated to a statically generated blog managed via <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a>. That&#8217;s going to live at the current subdomain for this tumblr, in all likelihood. If you follow this via the dashboard, you&#8217;re going to be fine. If you follow this by RSS, well, all my rss shit is likely to be changing. I&#8217;ll keep you apprised.</p>
<p><a href="http://1fp.humanmade.org">1fp</a> is going to be archived. I&#8217;m pulling all of the content out of tumblr and will be putting together static pages that keep it all together. That&#8217;s likely going to happen a goodly while after the initial reordering of subdomains, rss feeds, &amp;c.</p>
<p>This is still some weeks off.<sup id="fnref:p20469961302-1"><a href="#fn:p20469961302-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> But since things may fail in unexpected ways as I try to roll stuff out, there&#8217;s a good chance I may not realize I need to warn you of a change before it&#8217;s too late.<sup id="fnref:p20469961302-2"><a href="#fn:p20469961302-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>So, I guess you&#8217;ve been warned.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<p>And knowing me, may very well <em>never actually happen</em>. <a href="#fnref:p20469961302-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:p20469961302-2">
<p>Also, it helps for me to blather on about things like this to help me sort out what I&#8217;m actually doing. <a href="#fnref:p20469961302-2" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
