Periodically I get this overwhelming urge to redo the way I exist on the
internet. The last time this happened I tore down an aging textile
install and switched over to tumblr for pretty much everything.

This time?

Tumblr will remain; or at least, the tumblr account will remain. I will
continue posting links, videos, pictures, &c on it. Textual content of
any substantiative nature is going to be migrated to a statically
generated blog managed via [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/). That’s
going to live at the current subdomain for this tumblr, in all
likelihood. If you follow this via the dashboard, you’re going to be
fine. If you follow this by RSS, well, all my rss shit is likely to be
changing. I’ll keep you apprised.

[1fp](http://1fp.humanmade.org) is going to be archived. I’m pulling all
of the content out of tumblr and will be putting together static pages
that keep it all together. That’s likely going to happen a goodly while
after the initial reordering of subdomains, rss feeds, &c.

This is still some weeks off.^[1](#fn:p20469961302-1)^ But since things
may fail in unexpected ways as I try to roll stuff out, there’s a good
chance I may not realize I need to warn you of a change before it’s too
late.^[2](#fn:p20469961302-2)^

So, I guess you’ve been warned.
