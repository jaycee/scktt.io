The problem here, I think, is that obsession becomes an easy stand in
for meticulousness. It’s an understandable mistake to make, honestly. An
artist or craftsman who is meticulous in the details of of their art or
craft is generally obsessed; the focus of that obsession is however
about something deeper than the number of icons on one’s desktop.

I don’t mean that a person’s obsessions are necessarily trivial—when
John Gruber and Merlin Mann asked people to [“pursue their obsessions in
a serious way”](http://daringfireball.net/2009/03/obsession_times_voice)
I agreed with them along with most of the people in the world blogging.
But to me, pursuing an obsession in a meaningful way means having some
perspective.

Be meticulous in your pursuits—save obsession for the things that
matter.
