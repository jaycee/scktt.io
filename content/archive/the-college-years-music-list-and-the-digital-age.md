Derek Powazek recently wrote about his [college years
playlist](http://powazek.com/posts/2035):

I went through the steps he listed, and weirdly, the vast majority of
the music I found was not my “college years” music. Most of my college
music was electronica from the early 90s and gothy rock music from the
late 90s, both genres I really got into in college. A lot of the music
unearthed by Powazek’s idea was indy rock and hip hop that I got into
*after* I graduated.

Some of this can be attributed to my tastes in music, which swing wildly
through genres and eras every year or so. But a lot of this can be
attributed to the changes in music acquisition that were already
occurring when I was in college: what I could discover and get into
wasn’t remotely restricted to what was popular more broadly.

This isn’t remotely profound; it is however moderately interesting.
