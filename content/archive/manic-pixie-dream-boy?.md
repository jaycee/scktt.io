So last night in a conversation that was sort of all over the place, I
ended up explaining the concept of the [Manic Pixie Dream
Girl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Pixie_Dream_Girl) to a
friend^[1](#fn:p13871435934-1)^.

Intrigued, he apparently googled it at home, and found out that it’s
been subverted—or at least lampshaded—in a few movies.

Which made me wonder. Hollywood loves being “creative” by doing the
obvious inversion of a trope. So is there a movie with a Manic Pixie
Dream Boy? And if not, why not?

    The Zooey Deschanel show was on. It was contextually relevant, if
    only just. [↩](#fnref:p13871435934-1)
