I’m looking into a project that can be most easily accomplished via a
component that is licensed under the
[GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

This means I get to join the large group of people wondering just what
the bounds of the GPL are.

-   If I modify the component, and redistribute it, I have to release my
    mods under GPL.
-   If I modify the component, but it’s only used via http access by
    some client, and I distribute the client, does the client have to be
    GPLed? What about the modified component? Does it count as
    distribution?
-   If I don’t modify the component, and it’s only used via http access
    by some client, and I distribute the client, does the client have to
    be GPLed? What about the modified component? Does it count as
    distribution?

My feelings (and assumptions) are that the second and third cases do not
require the modified component to be GPLed nor the client. But I don’t
really know, and the language doesn’t make it clear.
