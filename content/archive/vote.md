This is the greatest failing of the Democratic party. That when it comes
time to vote, we are more complacent and lazy than we claim the other
side is.

Please, for the love of whatever is important to you, go vote today. Do
not be complacent, do not believe someone else will vote for you, do not
let someone else’s voice be louder than yours.

Vote.
