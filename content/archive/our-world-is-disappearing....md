…not in the literal sense, but in the historical. None of the mediums
we’re using for storage (or at least none we were using from
moon-landing era on till about 5 years ago) are terribly stable long
term. So historically, in a few centuries, this period won’t exist.
There won’t be any real evidence of it, beyond suspect secondary
sources.

 Which means, in a future space, you’ve got the possibility of a
geniunely amnesiac society.
