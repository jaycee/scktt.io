OCLC was once a great service, but it’s gone a little too far.

[From Aaronsw’s blog](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/oclcscam):

> \[OCLC is\] demanding that every library that uses WorldCat give the
> copyright to all its catalog records to OCLC. It literally is asking
> libraries to put an OCLC copyright notice on every book record in
> their catalog. It wants to own every library.

This is ludicrous. Go read his post, and go [sign the
petition](http://watchdog.net/c/stop-oclc).
