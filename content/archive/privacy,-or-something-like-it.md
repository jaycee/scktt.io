Privacy has been on my mind a lot since my honeymoon.

No, I wasn’t concerned about some sort of honeymoon photos getting out.
While on our trip, I discovered that an
[author](http://journal.neilgaiman.com/ "Neil Gaiman's journal") and a
[singer](http://blog.amandapalmer.net/ "Amanda Palmer's blog") were also
in New Orleans, from the constant stream of data from they both post to
the web. Not only did I know they were in the same city, but I had a
rough itinerary of their every day. This, without any effort on my part
beyond reading updates in my twitter followed list.

In the same vein, you have Scott Kurtz, who [I linked
to](http://blog.humanmade.org/post/1985973308/shes-home "Scott Kurtz's blog")
some time ago as he was sharing everything in his mind about his wife.

Sure, these are celebrities (minor celebrities, perhaps, but still), and
as such, they’re always operating with a larger data shadow than the
average person. But inasmuch as they’re pushing what’s available in the
realm of self-promotion, one wonders how much this is indicative of the
future.

There’s a lot of talk that we’re heading to a world where to be
successful each of us will have to operate essentially as free agents.
In that environment, it’s possible that this strategy of broadcasting
everything will become a norm, not just in the walled gardens of
Facebook or other networks, but as a general lifestyle of marketing your
own life.

Given that possibility, [zegolf’s post about
privacy](http://drinkingfromamasonjar.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/the-eye-in-the-sky/ "Zach Egolf's blog")
seems more likely, in that over time we’ll simply have to accept that no
one cares about privacy in the same way that we once did. I wonder
though if we might instead have some sort of backlash, in time, where we
respond to this change by volunteering even less than we used to.

For what it’s worth, Gaiman is incredibly cool, and when I tweeted about
having discovered he was in New Orleans, he
[responded](http://twitter.com/#!/neilhimself/status/2875048524259329)
to me with where we could see him and Palmer.
