<div><p>Privacy has been on my mind a lot since my honeymoon.</p>
<p>No, I wasn&#8217;t concerned about some sort of honeymoon photos getting out. While on our trip, I discovered that an <a href="http://journal.neilgaiman.com/" title="Neil Gaiman's journal">author</a> and a <a href="http://blog.amandapalmer.net/" title="Amanda Palmer's blog">singer</a> were also in New Orleans, from the constant stream of data from they both post to the web. Not only did I know they were in the same city, but I had a rough itinerary of their every day. This, without any effort on my part beyond reading updates in my twitter followed list.</p>
<p>In the same vein, you have Scott Kurtz, who <a href="http://blog.humanmade.org/post/1985973308/shes-home" title="Scott Kurtz's blog">I linked to</a> some time ago as he was sharing everything in his mind about his wife.</p>
<p>Sure, these are celebrities (minor celebrities, perhaps, but still), and as such, they&#8217;re always operating with a larger data shadow than the average person. But inasmuch as they&#8217;re pushing what&#8217;s available in the realm of self-promotion, one wonders how much this is indicative of the future.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk that we&#8217;re heading to a world where to be successful each of us will have to operate essentially as free agents. In that environment, it&#8217;s possible that this strategy of broadcasting everything will become a norm, not just in the walled gardens of Facebook or other networks, but as a general lifestyle of marketing your own life.</p>
<p>Given that possibility, <a href="http://drinkingfromamasonjar.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/the-eye-in-the-sky/" title="Zach Egolf's blog">zegolf&#8217;s post about privacy</a> seems more likely, in that over time we&#8217;ll simply have to accept that no one cares about privacy in the same way that we once did. I wonder though if we might instead have some sort of backlash, in time, where we respond to this change by volunteering even less than we used to.</p>
<p><small>For what it&#8217;s worth, Gaiman is incredibly cool, and when I tweeted about having discovered he was in New Orleans, he <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/neilhimself/status/2875048524259329">responded</a> to me with where we could see him and Palmer.</small></p></div>
