Back in August Charlie Stross wrote a [pretty biting
article](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2009/08/merciless.html)
nominally about the release of Abdelbaset Al Megrahi but ultimately
about his perceptions of the American body politic:

He’s certainly entitled to his opinion, and I can see where he’s coming
from, but he went too general in his post. The United States has a
population of 300,000,000. That’s a whole lot of people to draw
conclusions about based on reporting that regrettably focuses on vocal
minorities as often as not.

Pointing a finger across the ocean to vent about a place with remarkably
different social norms isn’t productive. The United States surely has
problems, and Stross is right in noting that a portion of our population
seems to be ever more hardline; to move from that to “a cancer in the
collective American soul” is entirely too strong, and is in itself
lacking in the lower form of mercy—benefit of the doubt.
