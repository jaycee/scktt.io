I attended BarCamp this past Saturday, taking advantage of one of the
few free moments this month that I had. Quite a lot of interesting stuff
going on.

[My notes](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/375578/BarCampRDU/index.html),
such as they are, are available here. I’m not sure how useful they are
to someone who wasn’t there, but feel free to take a look.
