<p>We Democrats have trouble closing the deal. We have trouble continuing the push to the very last moment. We have repeatedly been blindsided by the fact that the other side votes regardless of the expected result, while we’re more contingent — making the effort if it seems necessary, relaxing when it doesn’t.</p>

<p>This is the greatest failing of the Democratic party. That when it comes time to vote, we are more complacent and lazy than we claim the other side is.</p>
<p>Please, for the love of whatever is important to you, go vote today. Do not be complacent, do not believe someone else will vote for you, do not let someone else&#8217;s voice be louder than yours.</p>
<p>Vote.</p></div>
