<div><p>Derek Powazek recently wrote about his <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/2035">college years playlist</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My playlist turned out to be 9 gigs of awesome and embarrassing musical throwbacks, heavy on the early hiphop and flannel rock. Itâ€™s kept me smiling all week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I went through the steps he listed, and weirdly, the vast majority of the music I found was not my &#8220;college years&#8221; music. Most of my college music was electronica from the early 90s and gothy rock music from the late 90s, both genres I really got into in college. A lot of the music unearthed by Powazek&#8217;s idea was indy rock and hip hop that I got into <em>after</em> I graduated.</p>
<p>Some of this can be attributed to my tastes in music, which swing wildly through genres and eras every year or so. But a lot of this can be attributed to the changes in music acquisition that were already occurring when I was in college: what I could discover and get into wasn&#8217;t remotely restricted to what was popular more broadly.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t remotely profound; it is however moderately interesting.</p></div>
