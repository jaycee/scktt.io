<div><p>As I&#8217;ve grown up, I&#8217;ve taken stock and noticed my wardrobe of baggy jeans and hoodies doesn&#8217;t really fit for a late-twenties, soon-to-be-married, recently-tried-to-buy-a-house guy. That, plus the input of <a href="http://putthison.com/">Put This On</a> has led me to start thinking about what a complete but relatively minimal &#8220;adult&#8221; wardrobe (that I would want to own) might need.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my take so far:</p>
<ul><li>Two well cut dark wash jeans</li>
<li>One dark color non-jean pair of casual pants (chino&#8217;s, I guess)</li>
<li>One pair of proper &#8220;dressy&#8221; pants</li>
<li>One good suit</li>
<li>Six or seven nice, but casual button down shirts</li>
<li>Two dress shirts</li>
<li>A handful of nice ties</li>
<li>Good black shoes</li>
<li>Good brown shoes</li>
<li>Two good blazers/jackets</li>
</ul><p>I have no idea if this is actually complete, and I&#8217;m sure the list bored you to tears. I&#8217;m just brainstorming here.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p></div>
