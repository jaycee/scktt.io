<div><p>I&#8217;m a regular reader of  <a href="http://waiterrant.net/">Waiter Rant</a>, and his <a href="http://waiterrant.net/?p=2284">recent article</a> gave rise to two points I specifically have to address.</p>
<p>The first is the main part of the article&#8212;the notion that you must tip extra at the holidays at your regular establishment. I have never ever heard of such a thing. I&#8217;m curious if this is a larger city thing, a north east corridor thing, or a New York thing.</p>
<p>The second point is his closing line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if you bought yourself something as superfluous as an iPad this year you better give the Salvation Army something or youâ€™ll burn in hell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can understand the sentiment, but this is so self-righteous that I have to call it out. There are a lot of perfectly valid reasons to not give a penny to the Salvation Army. Now charity? Absolutely you should give to charity if you have the disposable income. But I have serious qualms with actions the SA has taken&#8212;<a href="http://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/ArticleID/1824489">like threatening to close their soup kitchens as a political maneuver</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much content to this post. Just a question, and an objection.</p></div>
