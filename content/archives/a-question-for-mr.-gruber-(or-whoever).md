<div><p><a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a> today posted a reprise of his article <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/04/wee_bit_more_on_aac">A Wee Bit More on AAC, Ogg, and MP3</a> that raises an interesting point about the lack of support for Ogg Vorbis in Apple products.</p>
<p>To summarize real fast, his point is that Ogg Vorbis exists in a murky realm of likely nasty patent suits, since there&#8217;s a non zero chance that the patent holders on mp3 can cite infringment. Okay, I accept that as a fact. But what then of dear old mp3 itself? <strike>That type is used largely without any sort of licensing, so what&#8217;s to keep it from birthing a lawsuit as well? Did Apple license mp3 for the iPod and iPhone? Because if they didn&#8217;t, there&#8217;s risk in using that format as well.</strike></p>
<p><strike>Obviously they had to support it&#8212;mp3 is far too widespread to be an unsupported filetype in any commercial endeavor. But there&#8217;s no real mention of that very real (though admittedly probably unlikely) possibilty that the patent holders for mp3 will decide they want money for the use of their format.</strike><b> </b>(<b>Added 8/12/08: </b>Okay, apparently my info was way out of date and mp3s <i>are</i> licensed. Let that be a lesson to me.)</p>
<p>Lest people think I&#8217;m baiting here, let me explain: I&#8217;m legitimately asking if there&#8217;s more going on here than I realize, or if is just a case that the risk was worth it for mp3s but not for Ogg Vorbis. And further, I don&#8217;t really think the lack of Ogg support is that important&#8212;while I use Ubuntu as my default OS, my default CD ripping output is mp3. I&#8217;m no zealot. Just a curious guy with a blog.</p>
<p>So then: responses? Flames? Misinterpretations (valid and otherwise) of what I&#8217;m asking? The comments are all yours, folks.</p></div>
