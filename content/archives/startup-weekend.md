<div><p>(<b>Oops:</b> So I wrote this up sometime ago, and then never switched it from private to public. I&#8217;m a bad, bad blogger. Please put up with me a tad longer.)</p>
<p><strike>Lastweek</strike> About a month ago I went to an event called <a href="http://rtp.startupweekend.com">startup weekend</a>. Hell of a time. The basic premise is that in about 54 hours you go from a pitched idea to a finished product. The idea I joined up on, now known as <a href="http://www.dealcastr.com">dealcastr</a> didn&#8217;t quite make it to finished, but we&#8217;re still working on it.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not blogging about dealcastr today. Just about the weekend.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t done something like this, and startupweekend comes to your town, GO TO IT. Setting aside everything about how much fun it is to just grind away on getting something neat out the door in a weekend, the people you will meet are entirely worth it.</p>
<p>(<b>Added 8/8/2008:</b> I&#8217;ve had like a month to process on this, and I think I&#8217;ll be using the fodder from it to fuel some posts in the next couple weeks. I&#8217;m going to try really hard to have a Tuesday/Thursday schedule on this.)</p></div>
