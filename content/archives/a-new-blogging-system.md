<div><p>Based on posts like <a href="http://inessential.com/2009/01/30/new_publishing_system_tour_of_my_head">this</a> and system like <a href="http://github.com/al3x/simple-scala-blog/tree/master">this</a> I&#8217;ve started playing with my own ideas for a new system.</p>
<p>Totally static pages appeal to me&#8212;I get comments via Disqus, so I don&#8217;t run that on my server. Most other dynamic elements one needs for a blog can be outsourced. Having my entire blog in version control appeals to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking a system that pushes plaintext files in markdown through <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/">Jinja</a> and resyncs a main dashboard showing most recent posts. All rendered pages kept in a filetree that shows their post-time and title.</p>
<p>Properly tumbly stuff will stay here, of course. By which I mean, in tumblr. It&#8217;s conceivable that the subdomain for tumbling will be moved to something like tumble.humanmade.org and this site will be a proper publishing point.</p>
<p>More as this develops.</p></div>
