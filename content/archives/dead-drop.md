<div><p>A few weeks ago I took part in something of a stunt. A number of participants would consider it a hack, or a feat of some sort of engineering, or something. They&#8217;re probably half right.</p>
<p>I made, in the space of a few hours, <a href="http://deaddrops.com/">Durham&#8217;s first dead drop</a>. The notion, put quickly, is to recreate the old sneakenet method of dropping data using USB drives embedded in the cityscape. It&#8217;s as much performance as it is anything else, since real use would have to overcome any number of logistical problems not yet solved. Thus, a stunt.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s basic assembly. Using a knife or a screw driver, remove the case around the flash drive, to expose the tiny gumstick of PCB that is the actual drive.</p>

<p>Then, using electrical tape, wrap the gumstick to seal it.</p>

<p>You can also use plumber&#8217;s tape instead of or in addition to the electrical tape.</p>
<p>Once done assembling, you need to install it. There are tutorials that say you should take a drill to some masonry to create a hole for the dead drop, and then spackle it in. You can do this, if you like, but I think that crosses the line into vandalism. And not in a cool, banksy style way.</p>
<p>Instead, I just found a particularly large hole already existing and placed it there. It can be removed easily, making it&#8217;s placement less important. The downside is of course that someone might steal it, but as I said this is more stunt than practical. And I&#8217;m only out 5 bucks.</p>

<p>You can find the entry for the drop on the <a href="http://deaddrops.com/dead-drops/db-map/">dead drop database</a>. I would provide a link directly to it, but that&#8217;s not supported by the site. It&#8217;s currently the only one in Durham.</p></div>
