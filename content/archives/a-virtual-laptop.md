<div><p>I have a spare laptop from the days when I was pursuing linux as my full time operating system. It&#8217;s a nice one&#8212;a daru2 from <a href="http://system76.com">system76</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using it at work so that I would have access to a linux machine while using the windows workstation that I had. Recently though the department has switched over to linux for everyone (aside from a few holdouts) so I don&#8217;t need a separate linux computer.</p>
<p>This leaves me with a computer to experiment with.</p>
<p>I was thinking I would set it up as a multi-os system using virtualization. I would set up something very lightweight to run guest OSes. I thought it would be really cool to use <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/esxi/">esxi</a>. However, I have found that esxi is only really meant for use with servers. You can&#8217;t get a visual interface to your os on the computer running esxi&#8212;you can only dial in from another system.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m back to needing an actual OS to run a the guests. I want something ludicrously lightweight, so I guess I need a linux of some sort. And as long as I&#8217;m at it, I may as well have a GUI to manage the VMs with.</p>
<p>Right now, I&#8217;m thinking a stripped down version of Arch running wmii, but I&#8217;m not sold on any one thing yet.</p></div>
