I am a huge fan of [Kelly Sue DeConnick][0]. Sort of embarrassingly so. She and Warren Ellis are my two "subscribe to everything" comic authors.

One of her upcoming projects is ["Bitch Planet"][1]. She has a [design blog][2] for it that recently posted this awesome piece of art:

<a href="http://bitchplanet.tumblr.com/post/91961255945/non-compliant"><img src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/02a3137bf41e5a24e9bd569c49a20597/tumblr_n8te02vOlG1tdhm9ao1_1280.png"></a>

Awesome, right?

Absent any context for it beyond the notion of "non compliant" I saved the image, thinking I wanted it as a sticker or something.

And then [Splatspace][3] got a vinyl cutter. Using Inkcut, a plugin for Inkscape, another member at Splatspace helped me create the sticker and cut it out of white vinyl. It was a pretty good sample project, because the design is super simple and blocky.

The cutter, a Roland Vinyl Cutter, actually functions as a printer; you process an image in Inkscape to reduce it to just the lines you want, and then use Inkcut to send it as a print file to the cutter. It's a really simple process.

And here it is on my computer, my newest sticker (alongside Juju, Octocat, and Sherlock & Watson):
