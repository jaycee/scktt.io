<div><p>There are two seemingly opposed views you can take when programming.</p>
<p><strong>The Purist:</strong> <em>Things should be done in just this one right way, read in just this one way, work just so.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Realist:</strong> <em>This</em> should <em>be done just so, but for christ&#8217;s sake we just need this to work right now and I need to go get some coffee.</em></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not using <em>both</em> perspectives when coding, you&#8217;re probably doing something wrong.</p></div>
