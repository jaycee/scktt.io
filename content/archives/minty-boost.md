I have two problems<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup>:

1) My iPhone doesn't hold its charge very long
2) I travel for work, and my iphone doesn't stay charged for the entire flight if I use it to listen to music.

I'll grant these aren't unique problems, and there's a whole host of solutions out there. I finally settled on the [mintyboost][0], using the [Makerbot Energy Pod][1] case.

The mintyboost is a really nice project from Adafruit. It's not too hard, but does require a bit of soldering skill, and it's a really satisfying build. 

Here's my fully soldered up mintyboost:

Likewise, the energy pod is a pretty forgiving print. I botched several parts of it and was still able to assemble it with a minimal amount of filing down rough edges. This would be even easier if you use a filament that can be smoothed with acetone--I did not, so I was left with filing. Here's the assembled pod with the mintyboost inside:

You don't need to make the pod if you don't want; the mintyboost is named because it's designed to fit in a mint tin. The tin that it was designed for<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup> is no longer made, but the kit comes with a similar tin, so you can just use that. I just used the energy pod because I thought it looked cool.

I haven't yet been able to take it on a trip; I'll write another post about how well it works in practice.
